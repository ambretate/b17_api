# B17 API

Welcome to the B17 API! Inspired by the show Masters of the Air, this API provides information about the heavy bomber aircraft that played a pivotal role in WWII and beyond. 

During the B17's 9 year production span, 12,731 units were built. In this API's inception period, it will focus on a small subset of the planes used by the groups featured in the show, the 100th Heavy Bomber Group ("the Bloody 100th") and the 91st Heavy Bomber Group.
